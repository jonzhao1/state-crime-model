### State Crime Model
Data collected through the [Data Commons Python API](https://docs.datacommons.org/api/python/) for all 50 states in the United States about the population, median
income, median age, and total crimes for every year from 2011 to 2019. Dataset is used for a logistic regression model that predicts whether the crime rate for a given 
year and state will be greater or less than the national average crime rate for that given year. Visualizations analyzing the data was built using Tableau. Project utilizes a machine learning pipeline that incorporates big data technologies (Spark) and a cloud infrastructure (AWS).
